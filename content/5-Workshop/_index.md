# Deploy Machine Learning Model with Streamlit on EC2

#### Overview

In this workshop, you will learn how to deploy a Machine Learning application (Credit Card Customer prediction) using the **Streamlit** framework on **Amazon EC2** infrastructure.

Instead of using complex managed services, we will optimize costs and processes by hosting the entire application (Front-end and Model) directly on a single Ubuntu EC2 instance.
