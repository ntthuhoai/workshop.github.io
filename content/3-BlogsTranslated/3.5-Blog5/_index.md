# The future of customer service is here: From contact centers to experience hubs

by  Akshay Vemuganti  on  24 JUN 2025  in  [Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/contact-center/category/messaging/amazon-connect/ "View all posts in Amazon Connect"),  [Foundational (100)](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/contact-center/category/learning-levels/foundational-100/ "View all posts in Foundational (100)"),  [Thought Leadership](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/contact-center/category/post-types/thought-leadership/ "View all posts in Thought Leadership")  [Permalink](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/contact-center/the-future-of-customer-service-is-here-from-contact-centers-to-experience-hubs/)  [Share](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/contact-center/the-future-of-customer-service-is-here-from-contact-centers-to-experience-hubs/#)

Discover how Amazon Connect transforms traditional contact centers into AI-powered experience hubs that reduce costs, increase efficiency, and deliver personalized customer experiences at scale.

In 2017, we launched  [Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/)  to solve the challenges we conquered in Amazon’s own customer service operations. Our mission: deliver simple, cost-effective technology that creates exceptional customer experiences at any scale.

Today, AWS customers use Amazon Connect to support more than 10 million contact center interactions every day. But this is just the beginning. Our vision demands a fundamental shift in thinking: contact centers are no longer mere responsive hubs – they are experience centers that revolutionize how customers and businesses interact.

This transformation represents a seismic shift in customer engagement. Traditional contact centers wait for customer problems; experience centers anticipate and prevent them. Where contact centers focus on resolution times, experience centers create meaningful connections. This isn’t just an evolution in technology – it’s a revolution in relationship building between brands and their customers.

Imagine a world where every customer interaction is a perfectly orchestrated symphony of human empathy and AI intelligence, anticipating needs before they’re expressed. A world where geographical boundaries dissolve as AI-empowered experts delivers flawless service, making every customer feel locally served, regardless of location. Picture service environments as living organisms, constantly learning, healing, and evolving – where every interaction enhances the entire system’s intelligence. We understand customer journeys so profoundly that we craft magical moments of delight, transforming routine interactions into unforgettable experiences. Building conversational flows becomes as natural as thought itself, where human creativity and data capabilities continuously reinvent AI-powered customer experiences.

This is the future we’re creating with  [Amazon Connect](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/).

### **Our path forward: Four transformational areas reshaping customer service.**

1/ The power of predicting and resolving customer intent remains core to our agentic AI vision, with our  [agent assistance](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/q/)  empowering agents to deliver faster, more accurate responses. The result is a truly personalized, automated conversational self-service experience that sets new standards in customer engagement.

2/ Our unified customer intelligence approach breaks down traditional data silos through real-time profile unification across all touchpoints. By leveraging predictive analytics to anticipate customer needs and orchestrating seamless journeys across all channels, we enable proactive engagement based on customer signals, creating a truly unified customer experience.

3/ Global scale and reliability form the backbone of Amazon Connect through active-active deployment across multiple regions. Enhanced global telephony coverage combines with simplified capacity management to deliver unified and reliable global operations, ensuring consistent service delivery worldwide.

4/ Agent empowerment transforms the frontline experience through AI-powered assistance for every interaction, including real-time coaching guidance, and generates deep insights from customer conversations. A unified workspace for all channels streamlines operations, while automated coaching and development features enhance agent capabilities. Simplified tools and workflows reduce complexity, allowing agents to focus on delivering exceptional customer service.

### The paradigm shift

This transformation from contact centers to experience centers fundamentally changes business-customer relationships. Experience centers become strategic assets that drive business growth, not cost centers to be optimized. They transform from problem-solving facilities into opportunity-creating engines that:

– Generate real-time customer insights that inform product development

– Create proactive engagement opportunities that drive sales

– Build deeper emotional connections with customers through personalized experiences

– Turn service interactions into brand advocacy moments

Organizations that embrace this shift can gain a powerful competitive advantage. They don’t just respond to customer needs – they anticipate and exceed them, creating experiences that customers actively seek out rather than interactions they merely tolerate.

### **Why this matters**

The customer experience reaches new heights through personalized service across all channels, faster issue resolution, and reduced customer effort. Proactive engagement anticipates and addresses customer needs before they become concerns, creating seamless interactions that build lasting relationships.

The agent experience sees a dramatic improvement as seen with TransUnion,  [a 40%+ savings in annual costs](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/q/). Reduced training time and higher job satisfaction lead to better customer outcomes, creating a positive cycle of continuous improvement and excellence in service delivery.

Business agility becomes a competitive advantage through rapid innovation and experimentation capabilities. Organizations can quickly adapt to market changes, leverage global operational flexibility, and implement continuous improvements to stay ahead of evolving customer expectations.

### **Real results, real impact**

[Intuit’s](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/intuit-contact-center-case-study/)  flexibly scales its contact center from 6,000 to 11,000 agents during tax season with pay-per-use pricing, while maintaining capacity for up to 20,000 agents. Capital One’s CIO Gill Haus emphasized the value of their tech-focused approach,  [stating](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/customers/), “_Amazon Connect enables us to innovate like a tech company, meeting customer needs with speed and agility in a rapidly changing industry_.” The State of Rhode Island showcased unparalleled  [speed](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/chatbots-call-centers-connecting-citizens-critical-times/)  by deploying their entire contact center in just 10 days, successfully handling 75,000 unemployment claims on day one.

### **The path forward**

As we look to 2025 and beyond, our commitment focuses on expanding the boundaries of AI in customer service, simplifying and enhancing global operations reliability, creating more personalized and proactive customer experiences, empowering agents to deliver exceptional service, and enabling rapid innovation and experimentation.
